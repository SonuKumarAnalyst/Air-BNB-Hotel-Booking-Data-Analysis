## 🎯 Learning Objectives  

By completing this project, the following objectives were achieved:  

1. **Identify and Analyze Booking Trends** – Determine seasonal demand and neighborhood-wise variations.  
2. **Evaluate Pricing Strategies** – Understand the impact of service fees and amenities on overall pricing.  
3. **Understand Guest Preferences** – Identify top-preferred room types, price ranges, and ratings.  
4. **Assess Host Performance** – Analyze host verification, response rate, and number of listings.  
5. **Develop Predictive Models** – Build machine learning models for price prediction and booking demand.  
6. **Provide Data-Driven Recommendations** – Suggest improvements for hosts and Airbnb’s platform optimization.

## 🧮 Predictive Model — Price Prediction  

A **Random Forest Regression** model was trained to predict listing prices based on features like room type, location, number of reviews, and host information.  

**Model Performance:**  
| Metric | Score |
|---------|-------|
| MAE (Mean Absolute Error) | ≈ 25.7 |
| RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) | ≈ 41.2 |
| R² Score | 0.87 |

✅ The model accurately captured pricing patterns, providing insights for dynamic pricing strategies.

## 💡 Recommendations  

- **Optimize Pricing:** Apply dynamic pricing using real-time demand signals.  
- **Promote Verified Hosts:** Verified hosts receive more trust and better ratings.  
- **Encourage Reviews:** Listings with more positive reviews attract higher bookings.  
- **Enhance Amenities:** Listings with Wi-Fi, air conditioning, and kitchen access perform best.  
- **Neighborhood Focus:** Highlight areas with high ratings and competitive prices.

## 🏁 Conclusion  

This analysis provided a deep understanding of Airbnb booking behavior, pricing trends, and customer preferences.  
Through visual analytics and predictive modeling, the project identified key drivers influencing listings and suggested actionable improvements for hosts and the platform.
